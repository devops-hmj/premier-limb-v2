/**
 * smoke-test — fresh-zip verification of the HIPAA Vault handoff path.
 *
 * Unpacks dist/pll-wordpress-handoff-*.zip into a temp dir, builds individual
 * theme/plugin zips, boots a clean Playground (no --mount flags), and verifies
 * every key route returns HTTP 200 with a non-empty HTML body.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/smoke-test.mjs
 *        PLL_SMOKE_KEEP=1 node scripts/smoke-test.mjs   leave the instance up
 * Prerequisite: npm run package must have been run first.
 *
 * PLL_SMOKE_KEEP holds the Playground open on :9401 after the route checks and
 * skips the temp-dir cleanup, so other guards can be pointed at the PACKAGED
 * build rather than at the mounted dev server. That distinction matters: a fix
 * that only works with --mount is not a fix. Example:
 *     PLL_SMOKE_KEEP=1 node scripts/smoke-test.mjs &
 *     PLL_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:9401 npm run verify:paa
 * Ctrl-C, or kill the process, to release it.

// Four traps live here. The first three were found by the developer, the last
// two by QA, and every one of them produced a green run over a site that was
// not what it claimed to be.
//
// 1. The original gate scraped stdout for a readiness banner with a 90s
//    timeout. A cold boot off the handoff zip takes ~106-120s, so AC-14 was
//    simply unrunnable and no one had ever measured the packaged build.
// 2. Polling the port is too eager: PHP answers as soon as WordPress installs,
//    long before setup.php composes the pattern-built pages. 9/18 routes 404.
// 3. The CLI's "Ready!" banner means the HTTP server is up, NOT that the
//    blueprint finished. Six 30s page.goto timeouts.
// 4. A 200 on a seeder-composed route STILL does not mean the seed finished.
//    The static front page is assigned near the very end of setup.php, after
//    the PAA injection, so `/` served the BLOG INDEX at check time and the
//    route sweep recorded it as a pass. The seeded route was necessary, not
//    sufficient.
// 5. None of it proved the answers came from this process's Playground at all.
//    A leftover listener on the port satisfied every check above.
//
// So readiness now requires all three, in order: the child is alive and never
// reported EADDRINUSE; the nonce this run wrote is served back verbatim; and
// `/` is the real front page, not the posts index. The nonce is written by the
// last blueprint step and the front page is assigned by the last thing
// setup.php does, so together they bracket the end of the seed.
