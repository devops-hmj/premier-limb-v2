/**
 * The three procedure tiers shown on /limb-lengthening-pricing-options.
 *
 * Femur, Tibia, and Combined prices are Premier's confirmed 2026 numbers.
 * Maximum-height options are noted within the Combined tier rather than sold
 * as a separate package.
 *
 * Single source of truth for the rendered pricing grid
 * (components/v2/pricing/PricingPlans.tsx), the homepage teaser
 * (components/v2/Pricing.tsx), and the JSON-LD ItemList emitted from
 * app/limb-lengthening-pricing-options/page.tsx. Kept out of the client
 * components so the server page can import without crossing "use client".
